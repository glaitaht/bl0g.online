## <p align="center">About Project</p>

bl0g.online is simple blog project. Used laravel framework with bootstrap toolkit. It is not planned project, there is no er or skill tree, it is just a project that me and my friend need in 3 days, so it is what we got. Project's user side is very easy to use, it has couple tasks;

- User can see all the posts.
- User can login/singup
- User can add comment to post
- User can message to admins
- User can see selected category
- User can see the most used category
- User can see last 5 comment

Project's admin side;

- add/delete/edit posts
- add/delete categories
- approve/delete comments
- approve/delete users 
- can give admin privilege to users
- can see what searched 
- can see/answer user messages
- can edit about me page

## <p align="center">Bad things of this project</p> 

- Used only 2 controller and 1 model
- Hard to track a route
- After delete category, there ll be still posts to show belongs to that category (bug) [To fix that delete posts and comments]
